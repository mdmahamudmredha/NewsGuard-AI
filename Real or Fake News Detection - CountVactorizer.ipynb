    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "1. **`import pandas as pd`**  \n",
    "   - Imports the **Pandas** library (used for data manipulation and analysis) and assigns it the alias `pd` (a common shorthand).  \n",
    "   - Pandas provides tools like **DataFrames** and **Series** for handling structured data (e.g., CSV files, Excel sheets).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`import numpy as np`**  \n",
    "   - Imports the **NumPy** library (used for numerical computing) and assigns it the alias `np`.  \n",
    "   - NumPy offers support for **arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions**, making it essential for scientific computing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Use Cases:**  \n",
    "- **Pandas (`pd`):** Data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and analysis.  \n",
    "- **NumPy (`np`):** Mathematical operations, linear algebra, and array processing.  \n",

       "       \"Time: Investigating Hillary is an Attack on All Women November 1, 2016 \\nGood morning. It's Tuesday. \\nWho's up for another silly attempt to claim that Hillary Clinton is only being investigated for her rogue email setup because she's a woman? This gem comes from Robin Lakoff, a Berkeley professor in sustained incoherence and special pleading. \\nHillary Clinton’s Emailgate Is an Attack on Women \\n'It's not about emails; it's about public communication by a woman’ \\nI am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It’s us. \\nThe only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? \\nHis name was General Petraeus. Thank you. Have a nice day. \\nClinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she’s doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. \\nThat escalated quickly. And incoherently. Also I'm pretty sure it's not the 20s or whatever decade Robin is parodying or channeling. But yes, Hillary Clinton is only in this mess because she's a woman. It has nothing to do with anything else. That must be why Albright and Rice weren't in the center of similar scandals. \\nIf the candidate were male, there would be no scolding and no “scandal.” Those very ideas would be absurd. Men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech. In theory, so do women, but that, as the creationists like to say, is only a theory. \\nEmailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech. It's illegal for both public officials of both genders. \\nBut here’s Hillary Rodham Clinton, the very public stand-in for all bossy, uppity and ambitious women. Here are her emails. And since it’s a woman, doing what decent women should never do—engaging in high-level public communication—well, there must be something wrong with that, even if we can’t quite find that something. \\nIllegally... emailing... classified... information.\",\n",

       "       \"Fearing Election Day Trouble, Some US Schools Cancel Classes Newsmax, October 26, 2016 \\nRigged elections. Vigilante observers. Angry voters. The claims, threats and passions surrounding the presidential race have led communities around the U.S. to move polling places out of schools or cancel classes on Election Day. \\nThe fear is that the ugly rhetoric of the campaign could escalate into confrontations and even violence in school hallways, endangering students. \\n“If anybody can sit there and say they don’t think this is a contentious election, then they aren’t paying much attention,” said Ed Tolan, police chief in Falmouth, Maine, which decided to call off classes on Election Day and put additional officers on duty Nov. 8. \\n{snip} \\nSchools are popular polling places because they have plenty of parking and are usually centrally located. It’s difficult to say how many school-based polling places have been moved this year, given how decentralized the voting process is across the country. \\nBut state and local officials say voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. \\n“There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering, that we didn’t have 15 or 20 years ago. What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something?” said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. “If that happens at a school, then that’s certainly concerning.” \\n{snip} \\nEaston Superintendent John Reinhart wanted to get voting out of schools altogether but was rebuffed by county election officials. So the school board canceled classes on Election Day. \\n“If you take the personalities away and cast the emotion with the election aside, one has to ask the question: ‘Are our schools the best places for that activity to take place?'” he said. “I just think we’ve reached the point where we need to look at other locations.” \\n{snip}\",\n",
       "       'President Obama’s appearance at a town hall meeting Thursday night on “Guns in America” was an orchestrated performance by invitation only. But event, hosted by CNN at George Mason University, saw anchor Anderson Cooper continually surprise the president.\\n\\nCooper demonstrated a deft command of the facts related to the gun issue and that came through with his guests and in his questions—though, as the evening unfolded, he continually let the president get away with untruths about his past positions.\\n\\nSurprisingly, both sides of the issue were present in the small room—though, judging by audience applause, most were anti-gun-freedom.\\n\\nSome of the moments were unintentionally revealing.\\n\\nCooper began by asking President Obama if he’d ever owned a gun. Mr. Obama sat up in surprise and said “no.” But, after a search for words, the president said he shoots skeet sometimes at Camp David before adding that he’s not much “of a marksman.” When he said that anyone who enjoys the shotgun sports knew he must not have shot skeet much, as “marksmanship” is a term used for target shooting, not by those who shoot skeet, trap or sporting clays.\\n\\nWhen Cooper shifted the discussion to why the president chose to use executive actions on the gun issue, instead of working with Congress, Cooper asked the president if he would meet with the NRA. The president said, “I’m happy to meet with the NRA,” but as he said it he had this snarky smile on his face that would have been more fitting on one of his late show appearances.\\n\\nNow, CNN says they invited President Obama to this live “town hall” on guns at George Mason University and that they later invited the NRA. The NRA, however, said they’d rather not play along with a “public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House.”\\n\\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the trade association for firearms manufacturers, also declined an invitation. Larry Keane, senior vice president and general counsel to the NSSF, told me, “We declined the invitation because it is a White House-orchestrated made-for-TV event and not an opportunity for a genuine dialogue or an effort to find common ground. We remain disappointed that the president has chosen to demagogue the issue for political purposes instead of providing real leadership like working to advance Rep. Tim Murphy’s bipartisan legislation to address the issue of mental health, which is the common denominator in mass shootings.”\\n\\nGiven Obama’s—and CNN’s—attacks on the NRA and gun manufacturers in general, it is hard to blame them for passing on the invitation, but in retrospect Cooper might have made them wish they were there to help keep President Obama squirming.\\n\\nAs squirm he did—with the facts and in his seat.\\n\\nTaya Kyle, the wife of the late “American Sniper” Chris Kyle, was the first person Cooper called on. Kyle recently won a gun competition using the latest in sniper technology. She is a confident straight shooter. She pointed out that while the murder rate is at an all-time low, gun ownership is at an all time high. And then she asked, “Why not celebrate who we are?”\\n\\nPresident Obama began shifting on his stool and searching for words to lawyer his way out of these basic facts. He finally pointed out that national trends don’t necessarily hold true in all locales, but he never had to answer why the areas with the strictest gun controls tend to have the highest murder rates.\\n\\nThere was also a rape survivor, Kimberly Corban, who, when called on said, “I have been unspeakably vandalized once already” before asking why she shouldn’t be able to carry a gun to protect herself.\\n\\nPresident Obama was really uncomfortable then. He began back peddling and said his current executive actions won’t interfere with her right to carry a gun. But he never had to explain that he has supported bans on concealed-carry permits.\\n\\nPresident Obama also repeatedly said that people can “just go on the Internet and buy whatever weapon they want.” But he was never forced to explain that any gun bought from a dealer over the Internet has to be sent to a local dealer that by law has to perform a background check before they can transfer the gun.\\n\\nLater, Cooper actually did challenge President Obama by breaking in and asking “is it fair to call it a conspiracy” that people think he wants to take their guns away. “Yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy,” said President Obama, who then claimed that he isn’t plotting take peoples’ guns away.\\n\\nBut Cooper didn’t force the president to address his advocacy for a renewed “assault weapons” ban, or for his administration’s public desire to use black lists, such as the no-fly list, to take away citizens’ Second Amendment rights without giving them even the basics of due process.\\n\\nThere were other questions that took President Obama aback, such as when Sheriff Paul Babue pushed Obama on how his proposals wouldn’t solve recent mass shootings. Cooper even broke in to say that “none of the guns used in recent mass shootings, I should point out, were purchased from legal dealers.”\\n\\nPresident Obama didn’t have a clear answer to say why he isn’t swayed by these facts. He meandered before saying, “The young man who killed those children in Newtown didn’t have a criminal record but he had access to an arsenal.” He referred to an attack in China where a person attacked people with a knife and said “the vast majority survived because he wasn’t wielding a semiautomatic.”\\n\\nAgain, Cooper allowed President Obama to escape an obvious allusion to the fact that he would like to ban semiautomatic firearms.\\n\\nThe president was also allowed to get away with a big lie on “smart-guns.”\\n\\nPresident Obama said, “[Smart Gun technology] has not been developed primarily because it has been blocked by the NRA” and firearms manufacturers.\\n\\nCooper didn’t challenge this point and instead called on a person in the audience, which changed the topic.\\n\\nNevertheless, this is a clear and provable fabrication by President Obama. As I detail, with interviews with many gun makers, law makers and gun experts in my book “The Future of the Gun,” the NRA and the NSSF, to name two pro-Second Amendment groups, have statements on their websites saying they are not opposed to “smart-gun” technology. All the manufacturers, the NRA leadership and more, point to laws that seek to mandate smart-gun technology—regulations previously backed by the Obama administration—that are what is impeding smart-gun development. Even “60 Minutes” noted this, and pointed out a New Jersey law on the books that would do this, in a recent report.\\n\\nPresident Obama said early on in the town hall event that “people occupy different realities.”\\n\\nAnyone who watched CNN’s “Guns in America” was certainly left with the conclusion that in Obama’s chosen reality he wishes he could, with a stroke of his pen, pass European-style gun controls in America.\\n\\nFrank Miniter is the author of The Future of the Gun\" (Regnery 2014) a book that gets to the basis of the gun issue. He is also the author of the New York Times Bestseller \"The Ultimate Man’s Survival Guide\" (Regnery April 14, 2009).',\n",
       "       'A man protests against international trade agreements TTIP and CETA in front of EU headquarters in Brussels on Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016.\\nThe Canadian government raised concerns over the European Union’s regulations on chemicals on more than 20 occasions over the course of a decade, according to a letter seen by Energydesk .\\nIn a note sent to the Belgian government on October 19 , the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) claims that the Canadian state challenged the EU’s REACH regulations at the World Trade Organisation 21 times between the years 2003 and 2011.\\nThe UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) describes the REACH regulations as providing “a high level of protection of human health and the environment from the use of chemicals.”\\nThe news will raise concerns that Canadian companies may use the trade and investment deal CETA to undermine EU regulations.\\n“The threat of undue Canadian influence on environmental regulations such as REACH is real,” CIEL CEO Carroll Muffett wrote .\\nThe CETA deal – which sets up private courts that enable foreign corporations to sue countries – has been held up by the British government as a model for post-Brexit free trade deals.\\nCorporate courts Canadian companies have also used the trade agreements to take legal action against countries on 42 occasions, according to data from the Investment Policy Hub — with Canada ranked 5th among the nations in which this type of investor-to-state lawsuit have been filed.\\nEarlier this year, for example, the Canadian pipeline company TransCanada sued the United States government for $15 billion over its decision to scrap the Keystone XL project — using a provision in the NAFTA trade deal.\\nCETA, which is currently being signed by EU members following a week-long blockade by Wallonia and two other Belgian regions, sets up an investor dispute system called the Investment Court System (ICS) .\\nIn fact the ICS was among the reasons that the Wallonian government took a stand, with the region’s leader Paul Magnette saying: “I would prefer that [the ICS] disappears pure and simple and that we rely on our courts or at the very least, if we want an arbitration court, it must provide equivalent guarantees to domestic ones.”\\nAs part of the newly negotiated agreement, the Belgian government will ask the European Court of Justice to rule on the legality of the deal — and the ICS in particular.\\nBeyond REACH REACH – the r egistration, e valuation, a uthorisation and restriction of ch emicals – is a set of extensive rules “adopted to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals” — so says the European Chemicals Agency .\\nCanada’s concerns – which were not formal actions, but rather issues raised at the WTO – largely related to rules around competition and whether the regulations would be burdensome to business .\\nThe 21 complaints spanned the administrations of the Liberal Paul Martin, when REACH was just a draft, and the Conservative Stephen Harper.\\nEssentially Canada – like the United States – takes issue with the European approach to regulation, which is described as the ‘precautionary principle’.\\nThis approach means products need to be proven safe by companies who seek to market them, before they enter the market. In North America, the burden of proof is on public authorities, which have to prove that a product is dangerous.\\nDocuments unearthed by CIEL show that Canada has filed objections to the EU using this approach to regulate endocrine disrupting chemicals, arguing that the “EU’s hazard-based approach could unnecessarily disrupt trade in food and feed”.\\nScientific studies show a range of health impacts caused by exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals – which are found in food containers and plastics – including IQ loss and adult obesity.'],\n",

    "''' Basic water utility fees will be waived for residents of Tokyo this summer in an effort to limit the impact of extreme heat, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has announced.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than ¥36bn ($250m; £186m) has been set aside for the subsidies, which will come into effect for a four-month period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We would like to create an environment in which all Tokyoites can live in peace even in the extremely hot weather we are expected to experience this summer,\" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heatstroke claimed a record 263 lives in Tokyo last summer, according to the Bureau of Public Health. Many victims did not have air conditioning or chose not to use it because of high costs.\n",
    "\"Due to anxieties over living (costs), there may be cases in which people don't use their air conditioners during a heat wave even though they own one,\" Koike added.\n",
    "\n",
    "By offsetting water costs, the government aims to encourage residents of the Japanese capital to use other cooling methods like air conditioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more than 60% of heatstroke deaths recorded indoors last summer, the victims had not turned air conditioning on, the Tokyo Fire Department said, according to the Japan Times.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, base water fees in Tokyo cost between ¥860 ($6; £4.50) to ¥1,460 ($10; £7.50) per month, depending on the width of the household's water pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional fees - based on water usage and paid on top of base fees - will be charged at their usual rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokyo has more than 7 million households and a population of more than 14 million, according to government statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Japan recorded its hottest summer on record last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperatures in June, July and August were 1.76 degrees higher than the average between 1991 and 2020, according to the Japan meteorological agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between June and September, nearly 8,000 people in Tokyo were taken to hospitals for heatstroke - also a record - with a majority of deaths recorded among elderly people.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "''' ,\n",
    "\n",
    "''' In a groundbreaking announcement today, NASA revealed the discovery of a vast underground freshwater lake on Mars that could potentially support human life. The water source, located beneath the southern polar ice cap, was confirmed using high-resolution radar imaging from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Scientists believe this changes the timeline for manned Mars missions significantly, with permanent human settlements on Mars now projected to begin as early as 2028.\n",
    "Dr. Michael Thomson, head of the Mars Exploration Team, stated, “This is the most compelling evidence of a habitable environment beyond Earth we’ve found so far.”\n",
    "Governments around the world, including the USA, China, and India, have announced plans to accelerate Mars colonization programs in response.\n",
